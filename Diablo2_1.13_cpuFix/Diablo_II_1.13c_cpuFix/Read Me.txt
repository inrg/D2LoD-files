# D2 CPU Bug Fix

The infinite loop cpu bug has been present for years but even at this point it hasn't been fixed by the game developers.
The bug causes Diablo II to always use 100% of a single core on any computer, 50% for dual cores and about 25% for quad cores computer.
Shoutout to those who shared their knowledge.

Open your Diablo II game folder and replace the old D2Client.dll file with the one you just downloaded.
The original D2Client.dll is included inside of the archive in case you experience any issues and need to revert.
