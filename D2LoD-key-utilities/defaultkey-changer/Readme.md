## D2LoD 26 length default cd-key changer
by Serby

---

This version of cd-key changer is made using the setup for Diablo II made by Blizzard.
It can be used for 26 alphanumeric characters keys.
It works well with versions 1.13d - 1.14d D2LoD, no matter of BN update or fresh install

Usage: Unpack where you want and then execute keyChanger26.exe

**Name:**

 - can be any name; 
 - this name you will see when you will try to connect 2nd time with same keyset on battle.net;
 
**D2 CD-key:**
**LoD CD-key:**

Then, choose as path the parent folder of your "Diablo II" folder, like:
C:\BlizzardGames\
or 
C:\Program Files (x86)\
You have to choose the parent folder, because this app, like the d2 installer will add /Diablo II at the end of the path, but you can also edit manually that path immediately after selection.

This utility will replace the default (instalation) CD-key from your  Diablo II folder.
Files that will be changed:
- d2sfx.mpq (D2 key)
- d2char.mpq (LoD key)
