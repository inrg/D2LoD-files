# D2LoD key utilities

**D2LoD_key_utilities** have 3 subfolders:

read the **Readme.md** file from folder you need to use.
These are working well with versions 1.13d - 1.14d D2LoD
*one exception cdkey_viewer for 1.14 got from digital D2+LoD-1.14b-Installer-enUS(GB), it's ok after you run the Serby's "defaultkey_changer" first (to install even the same keyset).

Game keysets are stored into these files:
- d2sfx.mpq (D2 key)
- d2char.mpq (LoD key)
