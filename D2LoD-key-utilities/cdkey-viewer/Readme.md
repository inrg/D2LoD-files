## D2LoD cd-key viewer
by hypnodok

---

Unzip and place anywhere the folder cdkey_viewer.

**Notes:** 
- you can copy/paste in viewer command window, and can select all text with mouse.
- you can also copy the path to your D2LoD from windows explorer's path.
- this utility works well for D2LoD 1.13d - 1.14 updated on main d2 server

For 1.14 got from digital D2+LoD-1.14b-Installer-enUS(GB), it's ok after you run the Serby's "defaultkey_changer" first (to install even the same keyset).

run cdkey_viewer.exe and you will see command window with:
